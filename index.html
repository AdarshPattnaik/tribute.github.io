                <br>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; Sushant Singh Rajput was born (21 January 1986 - 14 June 2020) in Patna in the state of Bihar
                    to
                    Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; His father is a retired technical officer and worked at Bihar State Handloom Corporation in
                    Patna. He was the youngest of five siblings and had the nickname Gulshan. One of his four sisters
                    Mitu
                    Singh was a state-level cricket player. He attended the St. Karen's High School in Patna. His family
                    moved to Delhi following his mother's death in 2002 where Rajput completed his schooling for
                    intermediate studies in Kulachi Hansraj Model School.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>
                    &nbsp; Rajput was reportedly an avid reader who was deeply interested in astrophysics and won the
                    National Olympiad in Physics. He secured admission in the Delhi College of Engineering (later
                    renamed
                    Delhi Technological University) to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mechanical
                    engineering.
                    According to Rajput, he did not have any interest in engineering but his family gave him no option
                    which
                    left him dissatisfied. He instead wanted to become an astronaut and later an air force pilot but was
                    also interested in Bollywood, being a fan of Shah Rukh Khan.
